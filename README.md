AI / ML Chatbot Internship Project : 

(Tasks 1–6 Combined Final Submission)

Project Title : AI / ML Q&A Chatbot using Vector Store and Streamlit

Project Overview : 
This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end AI/ML chatbot system built incrementally across multiple internship tasks. The chatbot uses vector-based semantic search to provide accurate, context-aware responses and is deployed using a Streamlit web interface.
The same base project was enhanced step-by-step to complete all internship tasks, ensuring continuity, reproducibility, and professional implementation.

Tasks Completed : 

Task 1: Simple AI Chatbot using Vector Store
Designed a basic AI chatbot architecture.
Implemented text ingestion using Sentence Transformers.
Generated embeddings and stored them in a FAISS vector database.
Enabled semantic similarity-based question answering.

Task 2: Data Ingestion & Retrieval Pipeline
Built a robust ingestion pipeline for text datasets.
Stored and loaded vector embeddings efficiently.
Implemented a retriever module for context-based search.

Task 3: Streamlit-based Chatbot Interface
Developed an interactive Streamlit UI.
Enabled real-time chatbot interaction.
Tested chatbot with AI/ML domain-specific queries.

Task 4: Domain-Specific Enhancement (Medical Q&A)
Extended chatbot to handle medical-related questions.
Added domain-specific data (e.g., diabetes Q&A).
Ensured accurate retrieval from the vector store.

Task 5: Multilingual & Sentiment-Aware Chatbot
Added language support (English, Hindi, Marathi).
Implemented automatic translation using Google Translator.
Integrated sentiment detection to adjust response tone for non-medical queries.

Task 6: Final Deployment & GitHub Hosting
Cleaned and organized the complete project structure.
Uploaded the full project to GitHub with a detailed README.
Demonstrated live chatbot execution using streamlit run app.py.
Ensured the project is reproducible and professionally documented.
