task 1 : Simple AI Chatbot Using Vector Store

Description :
This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end AI chatbot using a vector database approach. It leverages Sentence Transformers to generate semantic embeddings, FAISS for efficient similarity-based retrieval, and Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface.

Key Features:
Robust data ingestion pipeline for text embedding generation
High-performance FAISS vector store for semantic similarity search
Context-aware response generation based on retrieved documents
Interactive and user-friendly chatbot interface built with Streamlit

Technology Stack :
Python 3.10
FAISS (Vector Database)
Sentence Transformers
Streamlit

How to Run the Application :
Activate the conda environment
Execute the ingestion pipeline: python ingest.py
Launch the chatbot UI: streamlit run app.py

Project Status :
Successfully implemented, tested, and validated with multiple queries.
Developed and deployed an end-to-end AI chatbot using vector-based retrieval and an interactive Streamlit interface.
